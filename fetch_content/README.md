This Bash script searches for files with specific extensions in a specified directory, displaying or saving their content. To use it, run `./script_name.sh -p <search_dir> -e <extensions (comma-separated)> [-o output_file]`, where `<search_dir>` is the target directory, `<extensions>` are the file extensions (like `txt,csv`), and `[-o output_file]` is optional for saving the output to a file.
