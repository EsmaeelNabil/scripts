This Bash script helps you find and launch an Android emulator from your local Android SDK installation. Here's how to use it:

1. Save the script to a `.sh` file (e.g., `launch_emulator.sh`).
2. Ensure you have `fzf` installed and your Android SDK set up correctly.
3. Make the script executable: `chmod +x launch_emulator.sh`.
4. Run the script: `./launch_emulator.sh`.
5. Select an emulator from the list that appears, and it will launch the chosen emulator in the background. If no emulator is selected, it will notify you.
